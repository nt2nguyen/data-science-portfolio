# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects.

## Projects:

### [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

### [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/nt2nguyen/finding_donors): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.

### [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/nt2nguyen/customer_segments): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.

### [Deep Learning: Identifying dog breeds using CNNs](https://github.com/nt2nguyen/dog-project):  Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize the resembling dog breed. Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Karas, Tensorflow 
	

### [Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive](https://github.com/nt2nguyen/Machine-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/projects/smartcab): Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal. Under Construction.
